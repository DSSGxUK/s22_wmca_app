INTRODUCTION
------------

The project provides a dashboard for visualising and finding clean energy potential 
areas in the WMCA local authority. The tool acts as a frontend to the all the machine 
learning models build to pin point areas of interest in a local authority. The project
and code is open sourced and can be used by any local authority in the U.K. and other 
countries, given they have the correct data.

The repository for the machine learning algorithms can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mikecoughlan/DSSG_WMCA).

   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>
    ```
   Use command
   ```
   import streamlit
   ```
   If the respose does not provide any error you have successfully installed all the      dependencies.
   
RUNNING ON LOCAL DEVICE
-------------
 
 * Open a new Terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Use command
   ```
   streamlit main.py
   ```
   This would provide you a localhost link where the app is running. Something like this
   ```
   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

   Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   Network URL: http://192.168.0.24:8501
   ```
 
 * Now you can navigate the app to explore more and create your own changes. (A preferable IDE for editing could be Visual Studio Code, PyCharm or Sublime).

 TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

 * If the menu does not display, check the following:

   - Are the "Access administration menu" and "Use the administration pages
     and help" permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?

   - Does html.tpl.php of your theme output the $page_bottom variable?

FAQ
---

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but admin_menu.css is still
   there. Is this normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. the administration menu module only loads
   its stylesheet as needed (i.e., on page requests by logged-on, administrative
   users).
